I received my Masters's degree in the Decision Making and Strategic Negotiation research group from the School of Business and Management, Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2020. My thesis is design-science research about proposing a negotiation mechanism in the truck appointment system in a container terminal operation, in which I used an agent-based simulation approach. After I graduated, I worked as a Research Assistant and was involved in diverse projects such as interdisciplinary microgrid research with Physics Engineering ITB, business resiliency of public land transportation study with the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation, and business analytics research using smart card data in collaboration with PT Transportasi Jakarta. Currently, I work as a Business Research Analyst at The KPI Institute.
