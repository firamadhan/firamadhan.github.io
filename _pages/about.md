I received my Masters degree in the Decision Making and Strategic Negotiation research group from School of Business and Management, Institut Teknologi Bandung in 2020. My thesis is a design-science research about proposing a negotiation mechanism in the truck appointment system in a container terminal operation, which I used agent-based simulation approach. After I graduated, I worked as a Research Assistant and involved in diverse projects such as interdisciplinary microgrid research with Physics Engineering ITB, business resiliency of public land transportation study project with Indonesian Ministry of Transportation, and utilizing smart card data of public transportation with PT Transportasi Jakarta. Currently, I work as a Business Research Analyst at The KPI Institute.
