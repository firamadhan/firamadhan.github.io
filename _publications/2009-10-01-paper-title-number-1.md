collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This research proposes an overbooking reservation mechanism (ORM) to alleviate the negative impact of these no-shows. This research scrutinizes the detailed process mapping of the existing reservation mechanism, proposes an ORM, and conducts agent-based simulations to evaluate the ORM's performance against the regular and go-show reservation mechanisms at different levels of no-shows and working occupancies.'
